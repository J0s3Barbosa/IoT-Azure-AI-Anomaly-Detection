# IoT AI Anomaly Detection with Python and Azure

Welcome to the IoT Machinery Anomaly Detection project! This project leverages Python and Azure to detect anomalies in machinery, helping to predict and prevent failures before they occur. By integrating IoT sensors, advanced data analytics, and machine learning models, we provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and maintaining industrial equipment.

## Introduction

Machinery failures can lead to significant downtime and financial losses. Our project aims to mitigate these risks by implementing an anomaly detection system that continuously monitors machinery performance using IoT sensors. By analyzing the data in real-time, our system can identify unusual patterns that indicate potential failures, allowing for proactive maintenance and reduced downtime.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Use IoT sensors to collect real-time data from machinery, capturing metrics such as temperature, vibration, and pressure.
- **Azure Integration**: Utilize Azure IoT Hub for seamless data ingestion and Azure Machine Learning for advanced anomaly detection models.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in the collected data, identifying potential machinery failures.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up alerts and notifications to inform maintenance teams of detected anomalies, enabling quick responses.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Azure services to visualize data and anomalies, providing clear insights into machinery health.

## Benefits

- **Preventative Maintenance**: Detect potential failures early and perform maintenance before machinery breaks down, reducing downtime.
- **Cost Savings**: Minimize repair costs and production losses associated with unexpected machinery failures.
- **Improved Safety**: Identify hazardous conditions that could lead to machinery failure and take action to ensure safe operation.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Maintain optimal performance of machinery by addressing issues proactively.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: IoT sensors installed on machinery collect various performance metrics and send the data to Azure IoT Hub.
2. **Data Storage**: Collected data is stored in Azure Data Lake or Azure Blob Storage for further analysis.
3. **Data Processing**: Use Azure Stream Analytics to process and filter the data in real-time.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Deploy machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning to analyze the processed data and detect anomalies.
5. **Alerting**: Configure Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions to trigger alerts and notifications when anomalies are detected.
6. **Visualization**: Utilize Azure Power BI or Azure Dashboard to visualize data and detected anomalies, providing actionable insights.

## Implementation Steps
